                                <p>&emsp;Leveraging Python and SQL to develop a predictive model for forecasting customer demand based on historical request data. By analyzing patterns in customer behavior and request volume, the model accurately predicted future demand trends. Additionally, the system automatically updated buyers within the supply chain, ensuring they were equipped with real-time, data-driven insights to make informed purchasing decisions. The goal was to optimize inventory management, reduce stockouts, and improve overall supply chain efficiency.</p>

                                <p>&emsp;Utilizing Python, Apache NiFi, and AWS to build an automated system for collecting, comparing, and analyzing price and inventory data from multiple suppliers. Using Apache NiFi for data extraction, routing, and triggering, the system fetches product information from supplier APIs or through web scraping, stores it in AWS S3, and processes it with Python scripts. These scripts normalize the data, perform price and stock comparisons, and store the results in AWS DynamoDB for fast querying. The system allows users to easily compare prices and stock levels across suppliers, providing optimal purchasing recommendations. Leveraging AWS's scalable infrastructure ensures that the solution can handle increasing data volumes, while the automation of data collection and processing streamlines decision-making, saving time and improving cost efficiency.</p>

                                <p>&emsp;In this project, we used customer data from our GCP data lake to analyze and format first-time login and purchase data alongside the last 12 months of customer actions. The data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process was orchestrated using **Control-M**, which automated the scheduling and management of workflows. The data was processed using SQL for querying and aggregation, while Python scripts were utilized to perform custom data transformations and calculations. By combining this data, we were able to identify key customer engagement metrics, such as the transition from first-time login to purchases, and track ongoing behavior over the last 12 months. This analysis enabled better understanding of customer lifecycle patterns, helping drive targeted marketing strategies and improving customer retention efforts.</p>
